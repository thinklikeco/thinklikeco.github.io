                <p>I see you’re about to push what we have to production for the world to see, but let’s cool it for a second. I know this is exactly what I designed, but after playing around with it for a bit, something just doesn’t feel right. No big deal really, this is totally normal. Expected, even. And now it’s time for me to really earn my designer paycheck.</p>
                <p>Sure, those design comps I passed along may have been labeled “final”, but who can tell for sure if something will actually work based on mockups? I certainly can’t!</p>
                <p>So how will we know when it’s ready? Well, to be honest, it’ll just <em>feel</em> right. When it feels right, thoughts quickly become actions, and everything just flows naturally. It’s that "this is it" feeling you get when you know you’ve nailed it.</p>
                <p>Anyone can make something pretty. Some can make pretty things easily understood. But experienced product designers know that crafting a smooth experience means constant iteration, chiseling away until feels just right. Now is when we take what we have and make it great.</p>
                <p>I’m here to adjust, remove, simplify, and polish. Most importantly, I make sure everything comes together at a holistic level. This is the real value I offer you as a designer. Without it, I’m just getting paid for pretty pictures. And in this line of work, there isn’t much use for those.</p>
