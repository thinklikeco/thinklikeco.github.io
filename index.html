          <h3>How to Sell a Vacuum</h3>
          <p>Too often startups boast about their product’s features without ever acknowledging the need for which it was created. If you want my attention and my dollars, you’re going to have to convince me that you truly understand what I’m hoping to accomplish before you prescribe your solution.</p>

          <img src="images/running-out-of-time.svg" alt="Running out of time">
          <h3>Time Is Your First Constraint</h3>
          <p>Constraints are a designer’s best friend. The more constraints the better, as it’s all-too-easy to feel lost amongst the seemingly infinite amount of possibilities when designing anything, but especially so for digital products.</p>

        <a href="/p/their-questions-are-your-answer.html">
          <img src="images/user-questions.svg" alt="User questions">
          <h3>Their Questions Are Your Answer</h3>
          <p>What do you do when you visit a website for the first time? Perhaps you write down lists of things you like and don’t like about the design. Or maybe you take time from the task at hand to think about how it makes you feel. Personally, I like to talk out loud about the things I’m doing on the screen because I enjoy the looks I get from people around me.</p>

        <a href="/p/mind-in-the-gutter.html">
          <img src="images/seeing-whats-not-there.svg" alt="Seeing what's not there">
          <h3>Mind In the Gutter</h3>
          <p>Graphic novels are a vivid and engaging form of storytelling. They paint the scene and frame the mood without forcing your imagination out of the driver’s seat. I can’t tell if I’m watching a book or reading a movie, and I love it.</p>

        <a href="/p/the-one-screen-every-app-should-replace.html">
          <img src="images/no-dashboards.svg" alt="No dashboards please">
          <h3>The One Screen Every App Should Replace</h3>
          <p>People often ask me what kind of designer I am, and I like to say I’m the kind that puts apps on a diet. If I can find a way to get rid of every screen in your app while still making your service useful, I’ll do it. And if there’s one screen every app can do without, it’s the salesperson of user interface design: the dashboard.</p>

          <h3>A Diatribe of Sorts</h3>
          <p>The web progresses at an insatiable pace. And while the technical boundaries are constantly being pushed, sometimes it happens so fast we lose sight of how the web helps people live better lives. This has got me thinking about how I design for the web.</p>
