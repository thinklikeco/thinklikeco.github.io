                <p>When asked what kind of designer I am, I like to say I’m the kind that eliminates screens, reducing the workload for users and the business. If I can find a way to get rid of every screen in your app while still making your service useful, I’ll do it. And if there’s one screen every app can do without, it’s the salesperson of user interface design: the dashboard.</p>
                <p>Knowing how you’re doing is important, but how often do you look at a dashboard then do something to better the results? Not often enough! It’s helpful to know my performance is up or down compared to the previous period, but what I really want to know is what I should do about it. Time spent looking at charts is better spent improving your chances of success.</p>
                <p>Information typically seen on a dashboard is most useful when it’s contextualized in a way that enables users to take action. If you want to show results for your blog posts, place it on the blog listing, where the context is set and the user is already focused on their blog (and not their entire website). Better yet, use past performance as a guide by putting relevant statistics in the blog editor itself. Knowing the demographic breakdown of my blog audience is useful, but having it available when drafting a post makes that information impactful.</p>
                <p>So what should someone see when they open your app? Something that gives them an immediate next step. Not an aggregate report of past activity, but a push towards more activity. If your app is centered around a single task, the latest or most relevant item can be displayed, with visual prompts indicating the next step. Or you can greet your user with a to-do list for the day, where every next step is displayed right when they log in, acting more as a directory then another screen. Don’t just hope users know what action you want them to take, tell them.</p>
                <p>The real purpose of eliminating screens is to reduce cognitive load, which allows users to focus on one task at a time. When you combine every aspect of your app into one screen, you’re asking someone to do everything all at once. We know how unproductive we are when we multi-task, which is why replacing your dashboard with a clear next step gives users the best chance to succeed.</p>
