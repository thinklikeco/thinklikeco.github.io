                <p>The more I learn how to code the more similarities I see between computers and ourselves; the synchronous handling of tasks being one example. But it’s our fluctuating capacity to process information that is hardest to grasp; it’s not something you can see, but is most certainly felt. Like a computer, there’s a limit to how much information the human brain can process at once. When asked to do too much, our willingness to complete a task starts to wither and, eventually, shuts down.</p>
                <p>Over the past few months I’ve been working on my first real programming project, an iOS app called <a href="http://chillapp.us/" target="_blank">Chill</a>, and one of the most difficult aspects has been optimizing how it uses the memory it’s allocated by the user’s device. Like bad design you can disregard memory issues and your app will still work, but by no means does that give users the best chance to succeed.</p>
                <p>Whether I’m designing or coding, I’ve found that I follow the same process to get things working; one audience is just more predictable. Both humans and computers give you hints when you're asking them to do too much, both shutting down when you’ve taken it too far. But no matter who your audience may be, never ask more of them than what’s absolutely needed.</p>
                <h3>Managing how tasks get processed</h3>
                <p>To get the most out of the machine running your code, you dedicate memory to the tasks at hand, release anything you don’t need, and point to where it can access information in the future. The same can be done with people using your design.</p>
                <p>Enable users to focus more processing power on the task at hand by showing what information the system will remember for them. It can be as simple as indicating something has been saved and where they can access that information in the future.</p>
                <p>If tasks aren’t managed properly you run the risk of users shutting down and leaving your app. But this is entirely avoidable if you’re able to delegate which tasks users need to focus on, and, perhaps more importantly, which ones they shouldn’t.</p>
                <h3>Memory is predictable, intelligence is not</h3> 
                <p>The best designers lean on as many constraints as they can to first define the problem before creating any potential solution. If managed the right way, memory can be one of the constraints that helps to break up your solution into the right-sized portions for your users.</p>
                <p>Intelligence is a less reliable factor. As something that varies greatly from user to user, it isn’t something you can rely on to get the job done. And that makes the way in which you manage user memory all the more important.</p>
