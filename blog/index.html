        <h4><a href="user-memory-management.html">User Memory Management</a></h4>
        <p class="post-desc">The more I learn how to code the more similarities I see between computers and ourselves. Like a computer, there’s a limit to how much information the human brain can process at once. When asked to do too much, our willingness to complete a task starts to wither and, eventually, shuts down.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">They say it takes seven years to master a skill. Well, this fall it’ll have been seven years since I took a web design class where I learned how to create websites with HTML and CSS. I’ve come a long way since then, and while I still have a ways to go to truly master my craft, these seven years have taught me what really matters in product design.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">People often ask me what kind of designer I am, and I like to say I’m the kind that puts apps on a diet. If I can find a way to get rid of every screen in your app while still making your service useful, I’ll do it. And if there’s one screen every app can do without, it’s the salesperson of user interface design: the dashboard.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">Constraints are a designer’s best friend. The more constraints the better, as it’s all-too-easy to feel lost amongst the seemingly infinite amount of possibilities when designing anything, but especially so for digital products.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">What’s really behind Snapchat’s success? It sells itself as a way to share expiring content, but that isn’t the only reason for its rising popularity. While the urge to sext without penalty or tastefully doodle on the faces of friends rages within us all, the app’s unprecedented growth can actually be attributed to the good manners of those who use it.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">I see you’re about to push what we have to production for the world to see, but let’s cool it for a second. I know this is exactly what I designed, but after playing around with it for a bit, something just doesn’t feel right. No big deal really, this is totally normal. Expected, even. And now it’s time for me to really earn my designer paycheck.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">What do you do when you visit a website for the first time? Perhaps you write down lists of things you like and don’t like about the design. Or maybe you take time from the task at hand to think about how it makes you feel. Personally, I like to talk out loud about the things I’m doing on the screen because I enjoy the looks I get from people around me.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">When Jack Welch ran General Electric he fired the bottom 10% of his workforce every year. That may be harsh, but as a big company with a lot of moving parts, GE simply couldn’t afford employees with poor performance.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">Graphic novels are a vivid and engaging form of storytelling. They paint the scene and frame the mood without forcing your imagination out of the driver’s seat. I can’t tell if I’m watching a book or reading a movie, and I love it.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">Too often startups boast about their product’s features without ever acknowledging the need for which it was created. If you want my attention and my dollars, you’re going to have to convince me that you truly understand what I’m hoping to accomplish <em>before</em> you prescribe your solution.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">With the end of Adobe Fireworks now officially in sight I decided to give Sketch a try. I've always used Adobe products for design because that's all I knew existed when I started out. Fireworks has given me the ability to both explore different directions and produce polished designs quickly. However, it has also given me headaches because of poor performance with large files and other shortcomings.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">You don't need CG to tell a great story. In fact, it's probably easier to tell a story without it. CG and unique front end interactions can provide a captivating visual spectacle that draws attention to your work, but ultimately these types of technical feats distract users from the information cues you want them to pick up on. What's the back story? How do they know each other? These are important components that often become lost during the production of big-budget blockbusters.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">The web progresses at an insatiable pace. And while the technical boundaries are constantly being pushed, sometimes it happens so fast we lose sight of how the web helps people live better lives. This has got me thinking about how I design for the web.</p>

        <p class="post-desc">While any designer should reference Ben Schneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design and Dieter Rams' Ten Principles for Good Design, I’ve added these four principles to help guide me in my work.</p>
